### About us
We are a multidisciplinary research team at the intersection of omics analysis and artificial intelligence, 
dedicated to developing and utilizing machine learning, deep learning, and bioinformatics algorithms 
to address the challenges of deciphering the structure and function of biomolecules in life omics.

The research group plans to recruit 1-2 master's and joint doctoral students each year and is 
actively seeking postdoctoral fellows and research assistants with backgrounds in chemistry, 
computer science and/or bioinformatics.
