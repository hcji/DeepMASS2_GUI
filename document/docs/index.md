# Welcome to DeepMASS

DeepMASS2 is an effective and explicable tool for structural annotation. 
The core concept of DeepMASS2 is to predict the structure- related compounds of 
the unknown compound with MS/MS correlation based on deep learning, in order to 
locate its chemical space and choose the best annotation from the candidates 
retrieved from molecular database.
