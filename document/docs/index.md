# Welcome to DeepMASS

DeepMASS is an innovative software tool providing a robust solution for annotating and 
discovering metabolites within complex biological systems. Its foundation lies in a 
sophisticated deep-learning-based semantic similarity model, seamlessly connecting mass 
spectra to structurally related compounds. This connection effectively maps the chemical 
space of the unknown metabolites. DeepMASS maximizes the utility of mass spectrometry big 
data, positioning itself for further development as data scales continue to expand.

## Getting Started
Using DeepMASS locally, please reference the [document](), and refer the following video for quick start.
